As a chess enthusiast, I proudly present my first solo project!
Using java swing libraries for GUI, I built a fully functional chess app from scratch. 

This project is a simple yet functional chess game built using Java. The game allows two players to face off, 
following the classic rules of chess. A lot of effort went into implementing different chess mechanics, from piece movement to special scenarios like check, checkmate, and stalemate.

I undertook this project to gain a deeper understanding of Java, GUI creation, and the MVC pattern.
Although the code might not be the cleanest or most modular, the project was an excellent opportunity to dive into object-oriented programming and handle complex interactions.

Overall, this was a very rewarding and educational experience. It challenged me to think critically about software architecture, problem-solving, and user interface design.\
I had to dive into complex logic, manage state transitions, and adhere to best practices. I also gained a deeper appreciation for clean code and effective debugging strategies,
making this project a valuable step in my learning journey as a developer.
